# health-checks

Scripts that check the health of my computer (Google IT Automation: Git/GitHub course)

This repo will be populated with lots of fancy checks.

Currently this file contains the file `all_checks.py`.

This script will print "Everthing okay." if all checks pass,
or the corresponding error messageif some checks fail.
